<h2>[WEB1.1~6]</h2>
I've just started learning <strong>webpage code <u>HTML</u></strong>.
I've never heard of ATOM, the HTML editor. The first impression of seeing this page is like 'Wow, this is a hacker thing.'
Anyway, first of all, I learned how I make directory folder and how I open webpage I made with ATOM.
I made a 'web' folder in 바탕화면 and connect ATOM and web forder so that you can save files made with ATOM in web folder by clicking File and Open Folder.
Next, I made '1.html' file in the web folder. html next to the dot is 확장자 like hwp of Hangeul file so you must not change 확장자 name.
After you type something in the file and save by pressing Ctrl+S, you can open that on a web browser(for me, whale).
Press Ctrl+O and select the '1.html' file. Next, I learned TAG, the way of stressing some parts in the whole text.
<h2>[WEB1.7_혁명적인 변화]</h2>
If you want to see how sources are composed in a website, Press right button of the mouse and click 소스보기 or 페이지소스
<h2>[WEB1.8_통계에 기반한 학습]</h2>
I learned an useful website whcih shows how many tags worldwide websites have and what tags are used most by rank. (https://www.advancedwebranking.com/html/)
<h2>[WEB1.9_줄바꿈: br vs p]</h2>
If you need to begin a new line,<br>
Put br in bracket at the end of the line<br>
Or before a new line.<br>
The impressive thing of this tag is that you don't need to put closing tag at the other end.<br>
You just put one tag.
<p style="margin-top:40px;"> Pharagraph tag makes an pharagraph. If you use this tag.</p>
 Next line is one line away form prior pharagraph like this.<br>
 (Margin is a CSS language. Don't panic :) )
<h2>[WEB1.10_HTML이 중요한 이유]</h2>
In this lesson, teacher dealt the importance of HTML tag by comparing how normal people title and how intellectuals title.<br>
Normal people usually title by growing font size and making them thicker.<br>
Intellectuals usually title with just h tag.<br>
If someone search for an specific title, Headline used with h tag show up on top of other information.<br>
<h2>[WEB1.11_최후의 문법 속성 &img]</h2>
This lesson, I learnde how to insert images.
<img src="coding.jpg" width="500"><br>
And also leared "Attribute(속성)", besides of tag. For the case ahead, it is src and width.<br>
When tag is not enough to express what you want to show, attribute is for additional information.<br>

<h2>[WEB1.11_부모자식과 목록]</h2>
Honey tip1_If you press Ctrl and click or drag where you want simultaneously, Several cursors or blocks show up so you can type the more than 2 same words at one time.<br>
Honey tip2_Make a block on a paragraph and press tab key then the paragraph a little back off from the left-end side so that it's comfortable to see.<br>

or and ul are always with li.<br>
table is always with tr and tb.<br>

<h2>[WEB1.13_문서의 구조와 슈퍼스타들]</h2>
"title" tag makes the title of a tab.(Look at the top of this page.)<br>
Title is similar to bookcover so it' a big loss if you don't write the title.<br>
And<br>
If you look below at the ATOM wiondow, you can see "UTF-8" which means how it is saved.<br>
So the web browser also must open it in the form of "ATF-8"<br>
So the command language of open from is "meta charset(character + settig; 문자세팅)"<br>
And there are two big catagories;"head and body"<br>
"head" is about explaining the body part.<br>
"body" is about the contents itself that you intend to show.<br>
Every word and sentence is sure to belong to either head or body.<br>
And besides, here's the thing about even containing head and body; htme<br>
You must put html tag at the both ends of the whole text.<br>
And conventionally add <!doctype html> before html.<br>
<h2>[WEB1.14_HTML태그의 제왕]</h2>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" target="_blank" title="HTML specification"><h3>HTML: hypertext markup language</h3></a>
a tag is link tag(a; anchor)(href; Hypertext reference)<br>
<b>target="_blank"</b> makes hypertext open on a new tab.<br>
<b>title=""</b> makes tool tip show up when you put cursor on the hypertext.<br>
<h2>[WEB1.15_웹사이트의 완성]</h2>
This time, I made more perfect website.<br>
I linked index to each related page.<br>
And revised the title of each tab.<br>
And trimmed the entire form.<br>
<h2>[WEB1.16_원시웹]</h2>
<h4>Internet vs WEB <br></h4>
<p>
Internet is like a city <br>
WEB is like a building on the city.<br>
Internet is like roads.<br>
WEB is like a car driving on the road.<br>
In short, Internet consists of WEB, FTP, email and the other services.<br>
<h4>In 1960, Internet was born.<br></h4>
<p>
  1960 is right after nuclear war so everyone is afrad of nuclear's ramification.<br>
  And That's why people thought stronger communication system which is scattered so that the loss minimizes even if nuclear attacks center part. <br>
</p>
In 1990, WEB was born<br>
1990.10. frst web editor.<br>
1990.12. 웹서버 라는 프로그램을 만들고 그 컴퓨터에 info.cer.ch라는 명칭 부여(web의 메소포타미아)<br>
엘리트들만의 시스템이었던 인터넷이 웹을 만나면서 대중화<br>
인터넷이란 하나의 거대한 가상공간이고 웹은 그곳으로 가는 길이 아닐까?<br>
<h2>[WEB1.17_인터넷을 여는 열쇠: 서버와 클라이언트]</h2>
Internet isn't starting to be understood until you get two computers.<br>
Some information is going back and forth between web browser-installed computer and web server-installed computer.<br>
Web browser is calling for information so it's called client.<br>
Web server is answering the call so it's called server.<br>
From now on, our focus is moving form the former to the later.<br>
You've got two ways you can have people be able to come to yours.<br>
First thing is installing server in your computer for yourself.(web server)<br>
Second thing is being helped by a company doing that.(web hosting)<br>
